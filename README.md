## ⭐ Overview

UniNote is a robust, interactive web application designed to centralize and enhance the academic experience by providing a dedicated platform for course note management, sharing, and peer collaboration. It serves as the single source of truth for students seeking high-quality, organized, and authenticated study materials.

### The Problem

> Students often struggle with fragmented course materials, disorganized personal notes, and difficulty accessing reliable, peer-reviewed study guides outside of classroom hours. Traditional sharing methods are cumbersome and lack verification or structure, leading to inconsistent academic resources and unnecessary time spent synthesizing disparate information. The lack of centralized engagement tools also limits collaborative learning opportunities.

### The Solution

UniNote solves this challenge by providing a beautifully designed, component-based platform where users can securely upload, manage, and interact with course-specific notes. By integrating sophisticated user authentication, granular course organization, and community engagement features like leaderboards and messaging, UniNote transforms disorganized study material into a highly accessible, collaborative academic asset. The entire system is front-loaded, ensuring an incredibly fast and reactive user experience built entirely on the latest advancements in modern frontend development.

### Architecture Overview

UniNote utilizes a **Component-based Architecture**, enabling modular, maintainable, and scalable frontend development. Built entirely on **React** and leveraging **TypeScript** for strong type safety, the application provides a highly performant and interactive user interface. All application logic, including sophisticated state management and routing, is handled client-side using a modern build pipeline powered by **Vite**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To set up the UniNote web application for development or local testing, follow these straightforward steps. The project relies on a standard Node.js environment and the `npm` package manager.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

*   **Node.js:** (LTS recommended)
*   **npm:** Node Package Manager (comes bundled with Node.js)
*   **TypeScript:** Knowledge of TypeScript is beneficial for development.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using `npm`.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DivSlayer/UniNote.git
    cd DivSlayer-UniNote-c6dbd9c
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all necessary React, TypeScript, and utility dependencies, including `react-router-dom`, `lucide-react`, and `@google/genai`.

## 🔧 Usage

UniNote is primarily a frontend web application (`web_app`) accessed through a browser. The primary methods for running and building the application are managed by the `vite` build tool.

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with hot module reloading (HMR) and full debugging capabilities:

```bash
npm run dev
```

*   **Output:** The terminal will display the local address where the application is running (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
*   **Action:** Open your browser and navigate to the displayed address. You will be greeted by the `LoginPage` or the application's root element, allowing you to interact with the full UniNote interface.

### Production Build

To compile and optimize the application files for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

*   **Action:** This script bundles all TypeScript and React files, optimizes assets, and outputs the static, production-ready files into a designated build directory (typically `dist/`, managed by Vite).

### Local Preview of Production Build

If you wish to test the performance and functionality of the optimized production build locally before actual deployment:

```bash
npm run preview
```

*   **Action:** This command serves the static files generated by `npm run build` using a lightweight local web server, allowing for realistic testing of the deployed state.

### Key Application Flow

Once the application is running:

1.  **Authentication:** Begin at the `LoginPage`. If you require access recovery, the `ForgotPasswordPage` is available.
2.  **Dashboard:** Upon logging in, you are directed to the `DashboardPage`, which provides an overview of your academic activity and community standing.
3.  **Course Management:** Navigate to `MyCoursesPage` to view current enrollments or use `AddCoursePage` to expand your tracked subjects.
4.  **Contribution:** Use the `UploadPage` to add new notes or resources, which can then be viewed in detail on the `NoteDetailsPage`.
5.  **Community:** Check the `LeaderboardPage` to track contributions, and use the `MessagesPage` and `NotificationsPage` to stay connected with peers.
